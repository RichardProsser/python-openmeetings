Python-OpenMeetings
===================

Python 'wrapper' for [OpenMeetings API](http://openmeetings.apache.org/SoapRestAPI.html)


On reflection the code may need to be Jython, as OM is written in Java.

Or the code could be pure Python (with an eye to v3 form), calling the REST API as given via the above link.

Or both.
